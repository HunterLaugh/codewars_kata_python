Blaine is a pain
Blaine is a pain, and that is the truth - Jack Chambers
Background

Blaine likes to deliberately crash toy trains!
Trains

Trains look like this

    Aaaaaaaaaa
    bbbB

The engine and carriages use the same character, but because the only engine is uppercase you can tell which way the train is going.

Trains can be any alphabetic character

    An "Express" train uses X
    Normal suburban trains are all other letters

Tracks

Track pieces are characters - | / \ + X and they can be joined together like this

Describing where a train is on the line

The track "zero position" is defined as the leftmost piece of track of the top row.

Other track positions are just distances from this zero position (following the line beginning clockwise).

A train position is the track position of the train engine.
Stations

Train stations are represented by a letter S.

Stations can be on straight sections of track like this

When a train arrives at a station it stops there for a period of time determined by the length of the train!

The time T that a train will remain at the station is same as the number of carriages it has.

For example

    bbbB - will stop at a station for 3 time units
    Aa - will stop at a station for 1 time unit

Exception to the rule: The "Express" trains never stop at any station.
Collisions

There are lots of ways to crash trains. Here are a few of Blaine's favorites...

    The Chicken-Run - Train chicken. Maximum impact.
    The T-Bone - Two trains and one crossing
    The Self-Destruct - Nobody else to blame here
    The Cabooser - Run up the tail of a stopped train
    The Kamikaze - Crash head-on into a stopped train

Kata Task

Blaine has a variety of continuous loop train lines.

Two trains are then placed onto the line, and both start moving at the same time.

How long (how many iterations) before the trains collide?
Input

    track - string representation of the entire train line (\n separators - maybe jagged, maybe not trailing)
    a - train A
    aPos - train A start position
    b - train B
    bPos - train B start position
    limit - how long before Blaine tires of waiting for a crash and gives up

Output

    Return how long before the trains collide, or
    Return -1 if they have not crashed before limit time has elapsed, or
    Return 0 if the trains were already crashed in their start positions. Blaine is sneaky sometimes.

Notes

Trains

    Speed...
        All trains (even the "Express" ones) move at the same constant speed of 1 track piece / time unit
    Length...
        Trains can be any length, but there will always be at least one carriage
    Stations...
        Suburban trains stop at every station
        "Express" trains don't stop at any station
        If the start position happens to be at a station then the train leaves at the next move
    Directions...
        Trains can travel in either direction
        A train that looks like zzzzzZ is travelling clockwise as it passed the track "zero position"
        A train that looks like Zzzzzz is traveliing anti-clockwise as it passes the track "zero position"

Tracks

    All tracks are single continuous loops
    There are no ambiguous corners / junctions in Blaine's track layouts

All input is valid
Example

In the following track layout:

    The "zero position" is /
    Train A is Aaaa and is at position 147
    Train B is Bbbbbbbbbbb and is at position 288
    There are 3 stations denoted by S
